* Re-QA when we have more data:

	Make sure that clicking on a search result shows some activity indicator

* Usage Observations

	Swipe menu
		Retweet
		Reply
		Star
		Open (for links)
		Quote

	Shrink links should only be enabled if there is a URL in the
	text or multiple spaces

*  Missing Stuff

	Refresh user pictures when they change.  
		Currently, once we download a pic, we never update it

	TweetCell - Main Display
		geo info, and pic info?
		Replace foo -> bar in retweet with a bottom "Retweeted by"

	Chicken noises for reload
	Turning a search into a saved search
	Lists:
		Instead of managing lists, be able to "add user to list" in the UI in the profile view.
		Delete from list.
		Edit, Delete, Info
		Special List timeline controller that lets edit	
	User profile:	
		Red Color for Blocking users
		Showing first joined twitter
		Merge friends + followers in a single cell to save space?
		Showing a map for the user profile
		Show if the tweet is protected/user protected
	Remember last tab
	FullProfileView
		Needs an animating element while loading data from the network,

* Some settings that could be added

	display name
	date format 
	Font size
	Image quality

	Image service configurator
		Most image uploaders require API keys and disable
		commercial use, not worth the hassle

	Video service
	URL shorter
	Read Later
	
	User svcs:
	     tweet blocker
	     follow cost
	     favstar.fm
	     overlapr
	     favrd
	     tweetorites

	Manual
	Advanced

* Post 1.0:

	If the picture has been posted, do not bother trying to post it again

	Remember where the song is after compose, or restart every time?

	Add editing capability to searches to trim down the search list

	Nearby tweets on a map

	When favoriting/unfavoriting, we need to add those
	tweets to Favorites tab, or recompute that tab
	on demand.

	Themed cell renderers

	Retweet rendering style

	Direct messages style (grouped by recipient, by time)

	Direct Messages special view
		Grouped per user, blend conversation together

	Pagination support for StreamedUserViewController and StreamedTimelineViewController

	Cell "themes"

	Group user names by letter, and show the letter selector on right

	Queue system: would be nice if the delayed POSTs can insert
	data back into the main system.   Or alternatively make 
	POST synchronous and only put in queue if it fails?

	Showing User Pictures
		Needs a custom image loader for user profiles and urls that we detect as pictures

* Wanted

	ActivityElement to support a message in addition to the activity

* Http Stack

	Since all calls to the twitter API are to the same server,
	we should have an API that serializes all calls, maybe even
	reuses the WebClient instance.

	WebClient does not use the ThreadPool, instead it uses a 
	new thread, perhaps move to HttpWebRequest?

	Need HttpWebRequest for POST anyways (needed for inserting
	the result of a post).

	Should support high-priority vs low-priority requests.  Some
	operations like trend fetching do not have to be a top 
	priority.

* Idea: Memory management

	Modify the TImelineController to reload data on demand, 
	since CocoaTouch does not really kill leaf instances
	of view controllers so we can end up carrying a lot of
	data around.

	Problem: we can only do this if a child is not currently
	visible.

* TweetDetail

	Put a border around the image loaded.

* Application

	Remember where we are (drilled down on a tweet? or search)
